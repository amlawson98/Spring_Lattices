# Spring_Lattices

Molecular Dynamics of 2D and 3D Lattices Connected by Springs, and other interesting systems

Alex Lawson

Simulates various 2D and 3D Lattices of particles connected to nearest neighbors by springs. 
Meant to give some intuition to phonon modes and collective oscillations

Uses Tkinter for Graphics, all packages included in default Anaconda Distribution

3D animation system in folder D3_animate. Electrostatic_Sim does 2D simulations (and more). Lattice_sim_3d does 3D simulations.
